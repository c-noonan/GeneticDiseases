# GeneticDiseases

## Background and Overview

GeneticDiseases is a interactive tool that allows the user to click on various, prelisted genetic conditions and receive information about the conditions observed, genes affected, and chromosomes related to the condition. There is also an animation showing what the disease effects on a cellular level and why the symptoms of the condition manifest.

## Functionality & MVP

Users will be able to:
 - [ ] Read an overview of the genetic condition
 - [ ] Read about which genes are affected
 - [ ] See which chromosomes the genes affected are located on
 - [ ] Watch a short animation showing the cellular difference between an unaffected human and an affected one
 
 Also:
 - [ ] A short about section that remains stationary to the side of the list telling the user how to interact with the tool          and what to expect.
 - [ ] Links to my github repo and linkedIn page
